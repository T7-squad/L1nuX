# Chapitre 2 : Working with files and directories

## Exercice 1 

1.  Create a directory called "my_files" in your home directory. Inside that directory, create a file called "my_text_file.txt" and put some text in it. Then, create a copy of "my_text_file.txt" and rename it to "my_text_file_copy.txt".
2.  Use the "find" command to search for all files in your home directory that have the ".txt" file extension. Pipe the output of the command to a file called "txt_files.txt" in your home directory.
3.  Use the "mv" command to rename "my_text_file.txt" to "your_text_file.txt" inside the "my_files" directory.
4.  Create a subdirectory called "my_subdirectory" inside "my_files". Then, move "your_text_file.txt" into "my_subdirectory".
5.  Create a file called "my_archive.tar.gz" in the "my_files" directory. Use the "tar" command to archive the entire "my_files" directory into "my_archive.tar.gz".
